<h2>Getting to know UNIX and Linux</h2>

    <p>
        My exposure to UNIX came in bits and pieces;
        I first encountered UNIX culture a few years before I actually met UNIX itself.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        While I was doing my first (Computer Science) degree,
        I was introduced to regular expressions via <em>chef</em>,
        a  prettied-up version of the early UNIX editor,
        <em>ed</em>, which had been ported to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRIMOS">PRIMOS</a> system at
        the <a href="http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/">university</a>.
        (At the time,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Computer">PRIME Computer</a>
        was a significant manufacturer of minicomputer hardware,
        and a notable competitor to 
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation">Digital</a>.)
        At the same time, I met
        <a href="http://www.scs.carleton.ca/people/faculty/robert-biddle">Robert Biddle</a>,
        then a graduate student fresh from the 
        <a href="http://uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a>.
        Waterloo had a fairly famous Computer Science department
        (it was the home of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WATFIV_%28programming_language%29#The_WATFOR_Story">WATFOR</a>,
        a popular
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran">FORTRAN</a>
        compiler of the day),
        and was much closer
        to the UNIX wave that was then
        sweeping academia
        than New Zealand computer science departments,
        where UNIX had still to make a widespread appearance.
        Robert told intriguing stories of UNIX, C, and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratfor">Ratfor</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The next step on the way to meeting UNIX came when I met
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs"><em>emacs</em></a>
        after taking up a position teaching Computing at the
        <a href="http://www.unitech.ac.pg/">University of Technology</a>
        ("UNITECH"), in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lae">Lae</a>,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea">Papua New Guinea</a>.
        Although <em>emacs</em> is nowadays most often associated with UNIX,
        it ran on many other operating systems as well,
        and so my second meeting with a "UNIX" editor
	was once more on a PRIMOS system.
        Once upon a time,
	I could hack up reasonable LISP macros for <em>emacs</em>.
        However, after I left PNG,
	I didn't see <em>emacs</em> again for several years,
        and forgot most everything; so, until recently, I generally stuck to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi"><em>vi(m)</em></a>.
	Lately,
	driven by the need to maintain my sanity while working
	on large LaTeX/Beamer presentations,
	I've rediscovered the joys of <em>emacs</em>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        In 1987,
        I finally met UNIX and C in person.
        After a spell of traveling
        (along the way having the foresight to pick up an academic edition of
        Kernighan and Ritchie's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_c_programming_language">The C programming Language</a>
        in New Delhi), I ended up in England.
        There, a friend studying at the University of Sussex had access to
        a suite of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=HP_Bobcat_%28computer%29">HP Bobcat</a>
        workstations running HP/UX,
        and the university library had a copy of the first edition of
        <a href="http://basepath.com/">Marc Rochkind</a>'s wonderful
        <em>Advanced UNIX Programming</em>.
        For the next several weeks, I was glued to the
        workstation with AUP, K&amp;R,
        and a printed copy of the C shell man page at my side,
        writing a multitude of scripts and programs to test how things work.
        By the end of that time,
        I'd acquired a reasonable understanding of UNIX, C,
        and shell scripting.
    </p>

    <p>
        Soon afterward, I got a job at Digital Equipment Corporation (UK),
        which brought me back to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVMS">VMS</a>.
        VMS was in many ways a nice operating system,
        but after exposure to UNIX scripting, returning to 
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIGITAL_Command_Language">DCL</a>
        (the FORTRAN of command languages) was a chore.
        Later, I moved into the training branch of Digital,
        where I was the founding member of what soon became a small,
        tight group of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrix">ULTRIX</a>
        trainers in VMS land.
        I specialized in system programming training,
        and traveled quite a bit around Europe running system programming
        courses for Digital employees and customers.
    </p>
    
    
    <p>
        A return to New Zealand, a second degree
        (Psychology plus a good measure of Art History,
        which gave me a lot more practice writing),
        and a short spell working on MS Windows applications
        took me away from UNIX for a few years.
        I first got interested in Linux when I picked up
        some Slackware CDs in the mid-1990s,
        but didn't do any serious work again with it until the late 1990s,
        when I moved to Munich, where my first job was at a
        company whose infrastructure was entirely Linux-based.
        Since then, all of my day jobs have employed Linux.
    </p>
    

<a id="man-pages"></a>
<h2>The <em>man-pages</em> project</h2>

    <p>
        Soon after I began using Linux in earnest,
        I noticed errors and deficiencies in the system call
        and library function man pages.
        Eventually, I started sending notes, and then patches to
        the maintainer of the <em>man-pages</em> project,
        <a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/">Andries Brouwer</a>.
        When, in 2004, after more than 9 years as maintainer,
        Andries retired from the project and asked me to take
	over maintainership of the project, I accepted.
    </p>
    
    
    <p>
    	Although Andries did much good work, <em>man-pages</em> was
	a largely invisible project when I took over.
	One of my goals was was to turn that around.
        Under my maintainership, <em>man-pages</em> acquired:
    <ul>
        <li>
	    a version control system
       	    (initially, with <em>man-pages-2.00</em>, a private instance of Subversion;
	    later,
	    <a href="http://linux-man-pages.blogspot.com/2008/09/man-pages-goes-git-at-last_11.html">starting with</a> <em>man-pages-3.10</em>
	    in Sep 2008, a public
            <a href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=docs/man-pages/man-pages.git;a=summary">Git repository</a>);
	</li>
        <li>
            <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/changelog.html">changelogs</a>;
	</li>
        <li>
	    regular release announcements on the Linux kernel mailing list
	    (starting with <em>man-pages-2.22</em> in Feb 2006);
        </li>
        <li>
	    an occasional <a href="http://linux-man-pages.blogspot.com/">blog</a>
	    (<a href="http://linux-man-pages.blogspot.com/2007/10/getting-started.html">started</a>
	    in Oct 2007);
	</li>
        <li>
	    a <a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/">web site</a>
	    (<a href="http://linux-man-pages.blogspot.com/2007/11/man-pages-website-and-mailing-list.html">created</a> in Nov 2007);
	</li>
        <li>
            a <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/vger-lists.html#linux-man">mailing list</a>
	    (<a href="http://linux-man-pages.blogspot.com/2007/11/man-pages-website-and-mailing-list.html">activated</a> Nov 2007);
	</li>
        <li>
	   a COLOPHON attached to each pages in the release tarballs
	   (since Dec 2007, <em>man-pages-2.69</em>),
	   explaining how to report bugs in the manual page
	   (this was, I believe, a key step in increasing the flow of incoming
	   contribution);
	</li>
        <li>
	    a <a href="https://bugzilla.kernel.org/buglist.cgi?cmdtype=runnamed&list_id=838641&namedcmd=open%20man-pages%20bugs">bugzilla component</a>
	    (since Nov 2007);
	</li>
        <li>
            a set of
            <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/index.html">online pages</a>
            updated
	    (<a href="http://linux-man-pages.blogspot.com/2007/11/man-pages-website-and-mailing-list.html">since</a> Nov 2007)
 	    with each release;
	</li>
        <li>
            and a clear description of
            <a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/contributing.html">how to contribute</a>.
	</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        As of <em>man-pages-4.10</em> (March 2017),
        I've made a total of 176 releases of <em>man-pages</em>.
        I'm also the author or coauthor of around 390 of the 1000+ pages
        in the project.
        Working on <em>man-pages</em> is much more than writing documentation:
        any useful documentation involves spelunking 
        in the kernel and <em>glibc</em> source code, a lot of testing
        (the list of kernel bugs I've found while testing
        kernel and <em>glibc</em> interfaces is getting quite long),
        and review and critique of the design of new and proposed interfaces.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Most of my work on <em>man-pages</em> has been on a private basis,
        and though documentation is a task dreaded by many,
        some people like what I do:
        conference paper selection committees seem to favor
        <a href="../conf/index.html">presentations</a>
        on documentation and interface testing and design review;
        I've four times been invited to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Kernel_Summit">Linux Kernel
        Summit</a>;
        and for some months in 2008-2009, I was a paid Fellow of the
        <a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/">Linux Foundation</a>,
        working full time on the project.

        style="padding:5px;" alt="Michael and Cecilia" align="right" />
        I'm a New Zealander,
       	but have lived in quite a few places around the world,
        including 
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea">Papua New Guinea</a>,
        England, Switzerland,
        the USA (California), and for a short while Colombia
	(no, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia">not DC</a>).
        These days, I live in Munich, Germany.
        While I miss spending more time in New Zealand,
        Germany&mdash;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich">Munich</a>
        in particular&mdash;is a
        <a href="http://www.muenchen.de/int/en/themen.html">great place to live</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
	Once upon a time, I was a frequent movie-goer and 
        used to be able to participate in informed critical discussions
        of a wide range of contemporary films,
        but these days I don't get along to the cimema quite so often,
	and&mdash;thanks to movie trips with my daughter Cecilia,
	to whom my book is dedicated&mdash;my best
	critical overview is of children's films.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        When I find time (not so often these days),
	I'm happy to get lost in a book&mdash;mainly history,
	politics, biography,
        popular science, literary fiction, and some genre fiction.
        Otherwise, my interests include photography and travel
        (I come from an island and have visited quite a few others;
        I've also traveled in all continents except Antarctica).
